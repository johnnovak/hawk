*Immediate mode UI for Nim*

Koi is an immediate-mode UI library that uses OpenGL rendering via NanoVG. It was mainly invented for the dungeon mapper tool [Gridmonger](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/) (see screenshot below), but it's technically a general-purpose minimalist UI library with some restrictions.

Note that the API or even some of the functionality might change without warning at any moment.
